    "Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible epidemic mode: consider a disease spread in a population of individuals, without births, deaths, and migrations. Let $S_n$ and $I_n$ be the number of susceptible and infectious individuals on day $n$. The total population $N=S_n+I_n$ remains constant. A susceptible individual has a probability $1-e^{-\\beta I_n/N}$ to be infected and become infectious on day $n$, where $\\beta$ is the transmission rate. An infectious individual recovers with a probability $\\gamma$ on each day, and becomes susceptible upon recovery without gaining immunity. Thus, the change in $I_n$ can be modeled as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_{n+1} - I_n = S_n \\left(1-e^{-\\beta I_n/N}\\right) - \\gamma I_n =(N - I_n) \\left(1-e^{-\\beta I_n/N}\\right) - \\gamma I_n\n",

    "1. (10 points) Write a function SIS to compute the solution of the above model with an initial condition $I_0$, the parameters values $\\beta$, $\\gamma$ and $N$, for a period of time $T$. \n",
    "  * Arguments:\n",
    "     * T: the last time point\n",
    "     * I0: the initial number of infectious individuals\n",
    "     * beta: the transmission rate\n",

    "2. (10 points) This model has a unique nonnegative attactor, which is a fixed point. This fixed point changes as the transmission rate $\\beta$ changes. Make a plot showing how the fixed point changes with beta, for $N=2000$, $\\gamma=0.25$, and $\\beta$ values of $0.20$, $0.21$, $0.22$, ..., $1$.\n",
