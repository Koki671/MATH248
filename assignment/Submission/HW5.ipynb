    "  * Hint: Note that you will find two solutions. But one of them is not valid as it is not a real solution for $x\\neq 0$. Rule it out by substituting $x=1$ and check if it is real. A sympy expression has an instance variable named is_real to check if it is real. For example: given $x=\\sqrt{-1}$, then **x.is_real** is **False**.\n",

    "  * Hint: Find where $r'(x)=0$. Note that it cannot be solved symbolically. You need to define a lambda function and use **fsolve** or **scalar_root** to solve it. From thge profile, the maximum is near $x=\\pm2$.\n",
